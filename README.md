## üìö Usage Examples

### Paginated GET Requests

All GET operations (Company, Product, Sales Order) support filtering and pagination via the **Additional Fields** collection:

- **ID**: If set, fetches a single record by ID. If not found, falls back to filtering by ID in the collection endpoint.
- **Page Number**: The page number to fetch (default: 1).
- **Page Size**: The number of records per page (defaults: 5000 for Company/Product, 500 for Sales Order; these are also the max values).
- **Other Filters**: Use any other available fields to filter results (e.g., Inserted Datetime, Updated Datetime, Status, etc.).

#### Example: Get All Products, 5000 Per Page

1. Add the **Distru** node to your workflow
2. Select the "Product: Get" operation
3. In **Additional Fields**, set:
   - Page Number: `1`
   - Page Size: `5000`
   - (Optional) Add filters like Inserted Datetime, Updated Datetime, etc.
4. Run the node to retrieve up to 5000 products on the first page

#### Example: Get a Company by ID

1. Add the **Distru** node
2. Select the "Company: Get" operation
3. In **Additional Fields**, set:
   - ID: `<company_id>`
4. Run the node to retrieve the company by ID

#### Example: Get Orders with Status Filter and Pagination

1. Add the **Distru** node
2. Select the "Sales Order: Get" operation
3. In **Additional Fields**, set:
   - Status: `PENDING`
